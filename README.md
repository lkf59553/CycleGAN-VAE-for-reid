# Training CamStyle with CycleGAN and VAE

CamStyle is trained with [CycleGAN-pytorch](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)

Replace VAE as a generator based on zhongzhun007's work [CamStyle](https://github.com/zhunzhong07/CamStyle)
### Preparation

#### Requirements: Python=3.6 and Pytorch=0.4.0

1. Install [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/)

2. Download dataset

# Experiment result
Through FID (Frechet Inception Distance) and SSIM (Structural SIMilarity), two well-recognized indicators for evaluating image quality of GAN network , to campare the quality of images generated by Cycle-VAE-GAN and Cyle-GAN.

- Cycle-VAE-GAN training takes less time. Replacing the ResnetGenerator in the original paper with the VAE encoder greatly reduced the number of convolution layers and improved training time.
- Regardless of the visual contrast or FID, SSIM and other image quality indicators can be reflected, Cycle-VAE-GAN has better image generation capabilities.
- Compared with the original paper, the accuracy is better on its baseline, both mAP and Rank-1 are improved.
